  class ContainerProxy ; end

  # Represents an item in a Directed Edge database.  Items can be products, pages
  # or users, for instance.  Usually items groups are differentiated from one
  # another by a set of tags that are provided.
  #
  # For instance, a user in the Directed Edge database could be modeled as:
  #
  #   user = DirectedEdge::Item.new(database, 'user_1')
  #   user.tags.add('user')
  #   user.save
  #
  # Similarly a product could be:
  #
  #   product = DirectedEdge::Item.new(database, 'product_1')
  #   product.tags.add('product')
  #   product['price'] = '$42'
  #   product.save
  #
  # Note here that items have tags and properties.  Tags are a free-form set of
  # text identifiers that can be associated with an item, e.g. "user", "product",
  # "page", "science fiction", etc.
  #
  # Properties are a set of key-value pairs associated with the item.  For example,
  # <tt>product['price'] = '$42'</tt>, or <tt>user['first name'] = 'Bob'</tt>.
  #
  # If we wanted to link the user to the product, for instance, indicating that the
  # user had purchased the product we can use:
  #
  #   user.links.add(product)
  #   user.save
  #
  # == Pseudo-methods to return item info
  #
  # There are four special pseudo-methods that point to attributes / lists
  # related to the item:
  #
  # - links (Array<String>)
  # - tags (Array<String>)
  # - properties (Hash)
  # - preselected (Array<String>)
  # - blacklisted (Array<String>)
  # - history_entries (Array<HistoryEntry>)
  #
  # Each of those methods returns a {ContainerProxy}.  ContainerProxies have a
  # very simple API.  They simply support the operations:
  #
  # - {ContainerProxy#add}
  # - {ContainerProxy#remove}
  # - {ContainerProxy#set}
  # - {ContainerProxy#cached?}
  #
  # Those let you do things like add and remove individual tags (or preselected
  # items, or whatever) or set the entire list.
