module DirectedEdge

  # A Database is an encapsulation of a database being accessed via the Directed
  # Edge web-services API.  You can request database creation by visiting
  # http://www.directededge.com and will recieve a user name and password which
  # are then used to connect to your DirectedEdge::Database instance.
  #
  # Usually when getting started with a DirectedEdge database, users would like to
  # import some pre-existing data, usually from their web application's database.
  # The Database class has an import method which can be used to import data using
  # Directed Edge's XML format.  Files formatted in that way may be created with
  # the Exporter.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   database = DirectedEdge::Database.new('mydatabase', 'mypassword')
